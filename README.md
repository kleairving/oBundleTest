### Description
This is the repo for the oBundle BigCommerce dev test. It reflects the following requirements set for the Cornerstone theme:

-Create a product called Special Item which will be assigned to a new category called Special Items. Be sure to add at least 2 images during the product creation
  -The Special Item should be the only item which shows in this category
-Create a feature that will show the product's second image when it is hovered on.
-Add a button at the top of the category page labeled Add All To Cart. When clicked, the product will be added to the cart. Notify the user that the product has been added.
-If the cart has an item in it - show a button next to the Add All To Cart button which says Remove All Items. When clicked it should clear the cart and notify the user.
  -Both buttons should utilize the Storefront API for completion.
